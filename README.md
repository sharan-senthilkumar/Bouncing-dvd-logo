Bouncing DVD Logo Animation
This Python code creates an animated simulation of a bouncing DVD logo using the Pygame library. The DVD logo appears to bounce around the screen, changing color each time it hits a boundary. Here's a brief overview of the code and its functionality:

Prerequisites
Before running this code, make sure you have the Pygame library installed. You can install it using the following command:

Copy code
  pip install pygame
How It Works
The code initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, and loads an image of the DVD logo.

It sets the initial position of the DVD logo (x and y) to random coordinates within the screen boundaries.

The width and height of the game window are set to 800x600 pixels.

x_speed and y_speed variables control the speed and direction of the logo's movement.

The code enters a game loop (while True) that continuously updates the screen and handles user events until the user closes the window.

Inside the game loop, it checks for a quit event (e.g., closing the window) and exits the game gracefully if the event occurs.

The screen is cleared with a black background (window.fill((0, 0, 0))) in each iteration to erase the previous frame.

The logo's position is updated based on the current speed and direction.

Boundary conditions are checked, and if the logo hits the screen edges, it reverses its direction and changes its color to a random one.

The logo image is tinted with the current color, and the tinted image is displayed on the screen.

The screen is updated to display the changes.

The loop continues until the user quits the program.

Usage
Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.

Place an image of the DVD logo named "th (1).jpg" in the same directory as this script.

Run the script, and the bouncing DVD logo animation will appear in a window.

To exit the animation, simply close the window.

Enjoy the nostalgia of the bouncing DVD logo!
